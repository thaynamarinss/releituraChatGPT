# releituraChatGPT
ChatGPT rereading project proposed by the elective discipline of web programming (UFF).  
Project Description:  
In this project, I have developed a "Wizard GPT" application. Users can input any text, and the database will respond with a random phrase from the magical world of Harry Potter.  
I utilized the following technologies for this project: MySQL, Node.js, Sequelize, and Express.
